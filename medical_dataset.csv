They are employed in settings such as psychiatric hospitals, day care centers, mental health centers, prisons, special schools, and private practice. Some also engage in research."
What are the origins of dance therapy?,"Dance therapy originated as a profession in the 1940s with the pioneering work of Marian Chace, a modern dancer who began teaching dance after her career with the Denishawn Dance Company. She noticed that some students were more interested in expressing emotions while dancing rather than focusing solely on technique. Over time, doctors started sending patients to her, including antisocial children, individuals with movement problems, and those with psychiatric illnesses. Chace became the first dance therapist employed in a formal position by the federal government at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital."
Who were some influential figures in the development of dance therapy?,"Several influential figures contributed to the development of dance therapy, including Trudi Schoop, Mary Whitehouse, and Marian Chace. Mary Whitehouse, a Jungian analyst, developed ""movement in-depth,"" an extension of her understanding of dance, movement, and depth psychology. She later co-founded the contemporary movement practice called ""authentic movement."" Janet Alder furthered Whitehouse’s work by establishing the Mary Starks Whitehouse Institute."
How did dance therapy become formally organized and recognized?,Dance therapy became formally organized and recognized in 1966 with the formation of the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA).
